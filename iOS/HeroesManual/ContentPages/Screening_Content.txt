First impressions
    Is there someone in the room who might be a perpetrator?
    Reason for visit: Injury, physical complaint, etc.
    Does the patient show signs of physical abuse?
        Black eyes
        Bruises around the neck
        Sprained wrists
During routine questions
    Do they look to their partner for permission/confirmation?
    Do they have low self esteem? Do they show signs of self-neglect?
    Making excuses that don’t match up like tripping or being clumsy to account for their injuries
Confirmation Questions
    Observe: is there a third party in the room?
        Remove them if possible.
        Ex: “Ma’am/Sir, would you mind stepping outside for just a second, I have a few more confidential questions I’d like to ask [patient name]”
    “Do you have lots of stress in your life?”
    “How are things at home?”
    “How are things at work?”
    “Because relationships can sometimes cause health problems, we ask all of our patients the following question: Does a partner, or anyone at home, hurt, hit or threaten you?”
    “Do you feel safe in your relationship?”
What to do if they say yes
    Every conversation is different. Don’t blame the victim for not leaving. Keep them talking.
        “Thank you for telling me - I know it was difficult to do”
    Be supportive
        “It’s not your fault. You are not to blame.”
        “There are people that can help you.”
        “Do you have family or friends that can help you?”
    Show empathy
        “I believe you.”
        “I understand how difficult it is to change this situation. It may take some time to figure out what to do.”
    Discuss, review, and stress the importance of the safety plan with the patient.
