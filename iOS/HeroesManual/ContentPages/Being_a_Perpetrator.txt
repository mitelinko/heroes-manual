Why do they do it?
    Abuse is often a learned behavior in the formative years of the perpetrator
    Perpetrators rationalize their actions by putting the blame on an external influence like the victim or alcohol/drugs
    They often think of themselves as the victim of the relationship
    They always want control of the victim, and it does not matter if the victim is hurt in the process of obtaining that control
    Drugs and alcohol do not cause the violence, but can lower the inhibitions of perpetrators
What do they do?
    Emotional/Verbal/Psychological: put-downs, humiliation, gaslighting
    Financial: uses money to keep the victim from leaving
    Sexual: any unwanted touching, forcing/demanding sex
    Physical: hitting, slapping, grabbing, hair pulling, strangulation, etc
When do they do it?
    Perpetrators typically start with emotional or verbal abuse then escalate into physical abuse
    The abuse usually occurs in a 3 phase cycle
        Tension Building: the relationship between the abuser and victim is tense, abuser can easily be set off by a variety of factors
        Outburst: abuser outbursts with some form of abuse, attempting to dominate their partner
        Reconciliation: abuser often apologizes and often shows an abnormal amount of affection
Can they change?
    Abuse is a learned behavior that can be changed, but only a small percentage of perpetrators truly do change
    Batterer intervention programs are one of the more effective ways for changing perpetrators, but they need to actually want to change
    Signs of change include:
        Fully admitting to what they have done and taking responsibility
        Stopping excuses and blaming
        Identifying patterns of controlling behavior
        Accepting that changing is a long process
