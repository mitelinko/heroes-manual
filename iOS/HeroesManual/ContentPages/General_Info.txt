General
    Nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the US
        This equates to more than 10 million people per year
    More than 20,000 phone calls placed to domestic violence hotlines daily in the US
    The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the risk of homicide by 500%
    Intimate partner violence accounts for 15% of all violent crime in the US
    Women between the ages of 18-24 are most commonly abused by an intimate partner
    1 in 7 women and 1 in 18 men are severely injured by intimate partners in their lifetimes
    Around 40% of female murder victims are killed by intimate partners
    Slightly more than half of intimate partner physical violence is reported to law enforcement
Effects on Children
    1 in 15 children are exposed to intimate partner violence each year 5
    Studies show that 3-4 million children between the ages of 3-17 are at risk domestic violence exposure each year
    Children exposed to domestic violence are generally more anxious than those who are not exposed
    Children may blame themselves for the abuse and feel isolated
        Because the victim and offenders are preoccupied with the domestic violence, children often do not get the attention they need
    Children who witness domestic abuse have higher risks of alcohol/drug abuse, post traumatic stress syndrome, and juvenile delinquency
Economic Impact
    Victims of intimate partner violence lose a total of 8.0 million days of paid work each year.6
    Intimate partner violence costs exceeds $5.8 billion each year, $4.1 billion of this is for direct medical and mental health services
    Between 21-60% of victims of intimate partner violence lose their jobs due to reasons stemming from the abuse.6
    Over three-quarters of offenders used workplace resources at least once to express remorse or anger, check up on, pressure, or threaten the victim
Health Issues
    Domestic violence is associated with mental health problems including anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression
    Abused women have an increased risk of unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS
        Studies have shown that the risk of contracting HIV is at least two times greater for women who experience domestic violence
    Trauma victims are also at an increased risk of substance abuse
    Women who experience intimate partner abuse are three times more likely to have gynecological problems than non-abused women
    95% of men who physically abuse their intimate partners also psychologically abuse them
    Because strangulation, a common method of abuse, rarely leaves vivid marks, police may not recognize the victimâ€™s need for medical assistance
        Injuries from strangulation may seem light at first but can kill the victim within 36 hours
