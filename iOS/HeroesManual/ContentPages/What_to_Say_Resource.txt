Do’s
    Allow the patient time to talk about their experiences
    Show empathy and concern
        Example: I’m sorry that happened to you
        Example: You do not deserve that. It is not your fault
    Use open-ended questions to encourage conversation
    Ask the questions slowly and leave space/time for the patient to answer fully
        Often times patients are asked a ton of questions during their visit, which can feel like a rapid-fire interrogation. Be sure to take screenings slow, letting the patient know you have the time to hear their concerns
    Let the victim choose what they need from you
Don’t’s
    Avoid questions like “Are you a victim of domestic violence?”
        Patients are less likely to disclose when asked a yes or no question
        Patients may not identify or want to associate themselves with the word “victim”
    Don’t tell the patient how to feel
    Don’t force your personal opinions on them
    Don’t dominate the conversation
    Don’t offer to contact the perpetrator
