    Make it clear that they are not alone
        “Domestic abuse is more common than you might think. You are not alone.”
    Stress the importance of getting help
        “Abuse is not normal or acceptable. Your health and your children’s health can be affected if you don’t let us help you”

    Speaking slowly, making it clear you are not in a rush
        “If you need time to think, I can come back in a few minutes.”
