# Heroes' Manual

## About
The **Heroes' Manual** is an Android/iOS application aimed at helping healthcare professionals better communicate with and treat victims of domestic violence.

## Codebase
This repository contains 3 main sections: pure Android, pure iOS, and Xamarin (which compiles into both Android and iOS).
In order to run:
* the pure Android solution you need to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and the [Java SDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
* the pure iOS solution you need to use [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* the Xamarin solution you need [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)

## Installing the apps
Currently there are 2 ways to run the **Heroes' Manual**: out of a development environment; or get the iOS version off of TestFlight.

The **Heroes' Manual** will _**SOON**_ be available on the Android and iOS app stores!
